Section 1: Networks & Protocols (IP, DNS, HTTP, TCP etc)

"Protocols" - "System of Rules/Procedures"
"'Network' Protocols": Govern how machines and software communicate over network.

Packets transmit data over the web: 2^16 bytes.
Header and Data.
Header contains metadata contains IP of the source, other tags...
From experience it contains tokens, ip addresses, (?) Source.

IP: Internet Protocol.
IPv4 is running out. IPv6 is being adopted.

TCP: Built on top of IP.
Establishes the ordering of packets -> TCP must establish a handshake
in order for the packets to transmit.
"Listening" at a port opens a connection.
Similarly, a connection is closed in this way.

HTTP is an abstraction built on top of TCP/IP.
Request-Response pattern.
Client requests, server responds with information.
Browser is the client. Servers can request data from other servers,
still client -> server.
"HTTP doens't need to worry much about IP and TCP"?
Requests and responses have headers and bodies, which contain data.
HTTP requests and responses are similar to key-value pairs, JS objects.
HTTP methods: "RESTful" services.
POST, GET PUT, PATCH, AND DELETE
"POST/HTTP/1.1"
